### Mine images from PSD files
The application parses images from `canvases/mobile.psd` and `canvases/tablet.psd` files. 

`canvases/mobile.example.psd` and `canvases/tablet.example.psd` files are used as examples. Create your own PSDs based on them. If you get any unexpected results just compare your and example PSDs.

The script generates `images/mobile-file-list.txt` and `images/tablet-file-list.txt` files with lists of paths to generated files.

For instance,

```
----------------------
images/2/tablet/IMG_8151|serform
images/2/tablet/IMG_8150|sequence
images/2/tablet/IMG_8148|sample
----------------------
images/3/tablet/IMG_8153|copy
```

**Mine your PSD!**

Images add into the `images/` folder.

```shell
python mine-psd.py
```
