Tap the MENU button, then choose IMPORT VIDEO. A window with videos on your device will open. Tapping on any video will open that video for preview. Tap on USE in the top right corner to extract audio and put it on the next free pad in your song.

Warning: converting videos may take a while depending on your device.

Pro tip: use the iOS screen record feature to record videos during their playback in the web browser.
