## 4.9. Chopping Samples
Auto-Chop is available in SAMURAI mode, an in-app purchase.

Koala offers several modes to chop your samples. Tap on AUTO-CHOP in the TOOLS dropdown to open the chopping window.

Pro tip: change the volume, pitch, panning, tone, stretch and reverse settings of your sample as needed before entering AUTO-CHOP. Chopping is applied to a resampled version with those settings baked in.
