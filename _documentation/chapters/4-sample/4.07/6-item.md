{% flexible_image link="sample-editor-controls-2.png" alt="Attack Release Tone" %}

ATTACK: adds an attack envelope, making the sound fade in when played

RELEASE: adds a release envelope, making the sound fade out when released

TONE: add a low pass filter to the left of the center and a high pass filter to the right of the center

Pro tip: play with ATTACK and RELEASE while LOOP is engaged to get additional motion in your chops.
