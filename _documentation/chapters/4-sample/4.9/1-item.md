Image: transients mode

Use TRANSIENTS to automatically chop by transients within your sample. This mode is useful for shorter samples and drum breaks. Reduce or increase the amount of chops by swiping within the chops bar. The chops bar turns red if there are not enough free pads for the current amount of chops.
