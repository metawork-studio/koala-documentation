To see the MIX tab, activate “Show EQ” in SETTINGS. [Read more](./8-settings.html#84-extras-settings). 

Tap on the MIX tab to switch to the 3 pole EQ screen for the currently selected pad.

Each pad can have individual EQ settings. Tap and drag one of the three poles to adjust their settings. Spectrogram of the sample will be shown when the pad is played back. 

Pro tip: Use multi-select by tap holding EDIT button, then selecting all pads you want to adjust. EQ settings will be applied to all selected pads.
