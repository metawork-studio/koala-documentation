## Add samples to pads

Koala's default input source is the mic of your device. Tap any empty pad to start recording. Use one of the eight input FX to mangle the input signal. 

Switch the input source selector to import audio. Tapping empty pads will now bring up the file selector screen.

Another way to import samples is by either dragging them over from your files app or dragging them from the sample library of Koala.

You can also import audio from video files by selecting import video from the main menu.
