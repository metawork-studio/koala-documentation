## Resampling

Switch the input source to resample from app. 

Tap and hold any empty pad to start recording. Press a bunch of other pads with samples. Release the recording pad. You just resampled!

To resample a sequence while performing the live FX, switch off the tap to record setting. See general settings for more info.
