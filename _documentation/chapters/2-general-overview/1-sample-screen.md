Sample screen is used to load samples to the pads, manipulate samples and for resampling.

When using the mic as input, additional input effects can be applied during the sampling process.

64 pads are available for samples, divided into banks A,B,C,D. 

Use powerful features like looping, stem extraction, time stretching, resampling, EQ per pad and auto-chop. 

Tap and hold any free pad to start recording from mic input. Release to stop recording.

Pro tip: you can select additional output channels when Koala is loaded as AUv3 effect (not instrument).
