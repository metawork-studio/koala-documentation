{% flexible_image link="perform-live-fx-rec-armed.png" alt="Song record armed" %}

Select RECORD SONG from the MAIN MENU. Engage record mode by pressing PLAY button. Once you stop playback, recording will stop too and you will be prompted to save your song. 

Pro tip: add a few empty bars or switch to an empty sequence to add a tail to your recording.
