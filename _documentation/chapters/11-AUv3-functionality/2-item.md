## 11.2. AUv3 Effect (input captured)

{% flexible_image link="auv3-effect.png" alt="AUv3 effect mode" %}

Koala can be loaded as an AUv3 effect into any AUv3 compatible host application. This enables capturing of audio thru the INPUT. 

Loading Koala as effect is the preferred mode if you want to sample something INTO Koala.
