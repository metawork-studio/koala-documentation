### 10.1.1. Timestretch

{% flexible_image link="sample-timestretch-menu.png" alt="Timestretch" %}

Time stretching allows locking the playback of the sample to a specific set of beats and bars synced to the tempo of your song. 3 unique algorithms to stretch your samples so they fit perfectly with your song’s BPM, and change pitch independently of time. MODERN algorithm sounds buttery smooth, RETRO emulates classic sampler granular timestretch, and BEATS uses transients in your sample to make chops and loops to extend or shorten your sample.
