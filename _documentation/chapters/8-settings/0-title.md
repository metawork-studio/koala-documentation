Koala’s settings are divided into our groups: GENERAL, AUDIO, MIDI and EXTRAS. Most settings have a small question mark icon next to the titles. Tap on them to get a short explainer on what the option does. Tap the ABOUT button at the bottom to open the about Koala website. Tap OK to close the settings window.
