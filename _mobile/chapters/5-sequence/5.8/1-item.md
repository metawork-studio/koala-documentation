PEN: enables adding and removing notes in the grid view

VEL: enables changing the velocity of the notes. Tap and slide up/down on notes to change its velocity. This also works with selections.

DICE: enables randomization of the notes. Tap and slide up/down on notes to change their chance of being played. This also works with selections.

SNAP: enables snapping to grid when placing and moving notes.

UNDO: each tap undos one previous step

REDO: each tap redos one undone step

Pro tip: randomization is a great way to create ever changing sequences. Try this on your drums or melodic notes.
