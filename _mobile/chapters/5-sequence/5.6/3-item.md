GRID mode shows notes locked to one of the available scales: 

* CHROMATIC: all 12 notes per octave are available
* PENTATONIC: 5 notes per octave
* MAJOR: 7 notes of the major scale per octave
* MINOR: 7 notes of the minor scale per octave
* WHOLE TONE: 6 notes per octave
* DIMINISHED: 8 notes per octave
* HEXATONIC: 6 notes per octave
* JAPANESE: 5 notes per octave
* PELOG: 5 notes per octave
* YING ZHONG: 5 notes per octave

Use the selector to change scales.

Note: tap several areas to play chords of up to 5 voices.

Pro tip: resample a chord to a pad, then use that pad in grid keyboard mode again to play chords that are always in scale.
