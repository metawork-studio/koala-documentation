{% flexible_image link="auv3-multibus.png" alt="AUv3 Multi-bus mode" %}

Additional 8 output sources are available when Koala is loaded as AUv3 plugin. 

Note: only AUv3 hosts supporting multi-bus functionality make additional output destinations available. Currently, only AUM supports multi-bus format.
