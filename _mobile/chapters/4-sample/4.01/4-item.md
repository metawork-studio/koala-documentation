Resample from app mode lets you capture sounds within Koala. Tap any free pad to start recording, then tap other samples or play a sequence while using live effects in perform screen to capture longer passes on a single pad.

Pro tip: sequences can also be bounced to a pad with the bounce option in the main menu.
