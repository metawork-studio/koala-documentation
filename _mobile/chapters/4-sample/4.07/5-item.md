* LOOP: activates looping of the sample with three modes available. 
* PING PONG loops front to back and then back to front. 
* LOOP POINT creates an additional marker determining the beginning of the loop. 
* CROSSFADE determines the amount of fade out and fade in at the borders of the loop. 

Note: When LOOP is activated, ONE SHOT button changes to HOLD. Hold setting means pad playback is activated with a single tap and stops when you tap it again.
