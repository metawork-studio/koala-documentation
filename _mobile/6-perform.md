Perform screen is where you spice up your performance, resample with the 16 live effects applied and mix and record your song. Play around with effect combinations to find your signature sound. Get creative by resampling over and over with some effects applied.

Pro tip: get to know what the effects do by listening to how they affect your sound with different settings. A hair thin amount of an effect might add an interesting depth to your sound or create a texture.
